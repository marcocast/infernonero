					<h3>General Conditions</h3>
					<ul>

						<li >
							We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. You can deactivate your Choozzy account by sending an email with the request to social.choozzy@gmail.com If we terminate your access to the Service your account, your photos, comments, likes, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if your Content has been reshared by others).

						</li>
						<li >
							Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.

						</li>
						<li >
							We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use ("Updated Terms") from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.

						</li>
						<li >

						</li>
						<li >
							You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that Choozzy is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Choozzy reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with others, including when you submit or post Content or any personal or other information.

						</li>

There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application.

						</li>

You can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.

						</li>
						<li >
							Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that Choozzy may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.

						</li>
						<li >
							You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.

						</li>
						<li >
							You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.

						</li>
						<li >
							The Service contains content owned or licensed by Choozzy ("Choozzy Content"). Choozzy Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and Choozzy, Choozzy owns and retains all rights in the Choozzy Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Choozzy Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Choozzy Content.

						</li>
						<li >
							Although it is Choozzy's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Choozzy reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by Choozzy, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, Choozzy encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, Choozzy is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. Choozzy will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content.

							You agree that Choozzy is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. Choozzy does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.

						</li>
						<li >
							Any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Choozzy is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Choozzy in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of Choozzy, and Choozzy will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.

						</li>
						<li >
							It is Choozzy's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, Choozzy does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Choozzy is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.
